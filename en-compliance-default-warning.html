    <h2>Your home/assets are at risk if you fail to keep to loan terms.</h2>
    
    <p>We monitor and produce listings for the bridging market, bridging finance is what is known as a High Cost Short Term (HCST) financial product. High Cost Short Term products are not suitable for every situation; as the terms ‘bridging’, ‘High Cost’ and ‘Short Term’ indicate these products are more expensive than most other forms of lending and are intended to bridge a gap in finances for a short period.</p>
    
    <p>As a borrower you should take adequate financial and legal advice before entering into a finance agreement, we provide no advice only data on the market. We organise the data using open methodologies to present products and services that potential borrowers are likely to be able to apply for.</p>
    
    <p>Regulated brokers and financial advisors are the professionals able to understand your financial circumstances and suggest solutions which are viable to meet your objectives. In some cases bridging/HCST finance will not be suitable.</p>
    
    <p>As with any financial obligation, failure to keep to loan terms may put your home or assets at risk. Bridging finance is typically secured on property (homes/buildings/land) as this is preferred by lenders, securing finance on property puts that property at risk.</p>
    
    <p>If you choose to use a broker or financial advisor and when you interact with a lender they will present the risks of obtaining finance to you.</p>
